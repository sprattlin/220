# if you want to test something, run the function by right clicking and hitting "run file in python console"
# homework 2 has an outline, just replace "pass" with whatever your code is
# to run test, right click on the test underneath on the assignment/homework
#every time you're in a loop, the whole first body needs to finish before the code can come back to the top
# "hello world" is a STRING data type
# different data types allow you to do different things
# with numbers, you can use the math library
# numbers cannot be added to strings, only strings can be added to each other, and only numbers can be added to each other
#when adding strings together it is called a concatenation
# whole numbers are considered integer data types
# numbers with decimals are called floats, this stands for "floating point"
# the computer makes a distinction between integers and floats
# it's easy to do arithmetic with integers, computer recognizes it easier
# floats are roughly the estimate, or approximations because many decimals are never ending
# when possible, use integers in your code
# you can always check what data type you're working with, with the function "type"
# / does floating point division // does integer division
# "%" is a remainder or mod "modular arithmetic"
# you can tell evens or odds with mod, if you mod a number and the answer is 0, it is even, if you get an answer of 1, it is even
#mod is also useful for repeating
# abs is a built in python function that gives the absolute power of something
# import math function pulls up math functions
#dot notation specifies the module of math formulas/code you want to pull up
# like math.cos()
# math.sqrt()
# if you want to do a power of something use math.pow() with two numbers in the parentheses like 2,3 to signify 2 to the 3rd
# the values in the parentheses are called the parameters or arguments
# some functions have different amounts of parameters
# range() finds the range of numbers
# range can take up to three parameters (start, stop, step)
# accumulator pattern
